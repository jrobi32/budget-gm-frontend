# Player Images

This directory contains player images for the NBA Team Builder application.

## Image Naming Convention

Player images should be named according to the following convention:
- Use the player's full name
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Remove periods, apostrophes, and quotes
- Use lowercase letters
- Add the .jpg extension

Examples:
- `Kevin_Durant.jpg`
- `LeBron_James.jpg`
- `Karl_Anthony_Towns.jpg`
- `Donte_DiVincenzo.jpg`
- `Royce_ONeale.jpg`

## Adding New Player Images

1. Find a headshot image of the player
2. Rename the image according to the naming convention
3. Place the image in this directory
4. The image will automatically be used in the application

## Default Images

If an image is not found for a player, the application will display a placeholder with the player's initial.
